#### Using Signal for Group Communications
1. **Signal Setup**:
   - Ensure all group members install Signal from [signal.org](https://signal.org/).
   - Use **disappearing messages** to reduce the risk of leaked information.
   - Enable **registration lock** to protect accounts from SIM swap attacks.

2. **Verifying Group Members**:
   - Each member should verify the Signal safety number of others in the group.
   - Keep the group size limited to trusted individuals.

3. **Disabling Insecure Features**:
   - Disable SMS fallback to prevent unencrypted messages from being sent by mistake.
     
#### Using Tor and VPN for Anonymity
1. **Install a VPN**: Choose a no-logs VPN provider (e.g., Mullvad or ProtonVPN).
2. **Route All Traffic through Tor**:
   - Download the Tor Browser from [torproject.org](https://www.torproject.org/).
   - Always launch Tor after connecting to the VPN to hide your IP from both the VPN provider and external observers.

3. **Secure File Sharing**:
   - Use services like **OnionShare** to share files securely and anonymously.
   - Encrypt all sensitive documents with GPG before sharing via email or cloud storage.
     
#### Use Pseudonyms and Secure Profiles
1. **Assign Pseudonyms**: Each group member should use pseudonyms for all external communication.
2. **Minimize Personal Exposure**:
   - Avoid using personal emails or identifiable accounts.
   - Use burner accounts with services like **ProtonMail** or **Tutanota**.

3. **Obfuscate Metadata**:
   - Before sharing any media (photos, videos), use tools like **mat2** or **ExifTool** to strip metadata that could reveal locations or device details.

#### Encrypt and Protect Documents
1. **Use Full Disk Encryption**:
   - Encrypt all devices with tools like **Veracrypt** or the native disk encryption (e.g., BitLocker on Windows, FileVault on macOS).
   - Always back up sensitive files using encrypted storage.

2. **Obsidian for Secure Note-Taking**:
   - Use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for organizing research.
   - Encrypt your notes, especially those involving sensitive sources or government data.

3. **Sharing Documents**:
   - Use **cryptographic signatures** with GPG for verification.
   - Send documents over secure channels like **SecureDrop** or **OnionShare**.
     
#### Reduce Digital Footprint
1. **Social Media Hygiene**:
   - Remove identifiable information from social media profiles.
   - Use privacy-focused tools like **SimpleLogin** for creating throwaway email addresses linked to public platforms.
   
2. **Regularly Monitor Exposure**:
   - Periodically check for breaches or personal information leaks using services like **Have I Been Pwned**.

3. **Use Dedicated Devices for Reporting**:
   - Ensure that devices used for reporting are separate from personal devices to prevent cross-contamination of data and minimize the risk of exposure in case of an attack.
     
#### Protecting Physical Devices
1. **Use Anti-Tamper Measures**:
   - Encrypt mobile devices and laptops.
   - Enable remote wipe for all devices (e.g., **Find My iPhone** or Androidâ€™s **Find My Device**).

2. **Operational Movement**:
   - Avoid patterns in movement when attending meetings or reporting on-site.
   - Use decoy devices or multiple SIM cards for secure phone communication.

3. **Secure Location for Meetings**:
   - Conduct sensitive meetings in secure locations without known surveillance equipment or accessible networks.
     
#### Safeguarding Sources' Identities
1. **Use SecureDrop for Anonymous Tips**:
   - Set up [SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org/) to allow anonymous tips from sources without revealing their identity.

2. **Encrypt Communication Channels**:
   - Ensure all email communication with sources is GPG encrypted.

3. **Obfuscating Source Information**:
   - If dealing with whistleblowers or sensitive sources, never reveal their names in internal documents. Use code names or pseudonyms.
